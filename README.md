# Python-Chess
Creating a chess program that allows you to play against the computer (AI) and communicates moves between your computer and an Arduino over serial communication is a complex project. It involves several components, including chess logic, an AI chess engine, user interface, and serial communication.

Here is a simplified example of how you can structure such a program in Python. This example uses the `python-chess` library for chess logic and PySerial for communication with the Arduino. Please note that this is a simplified representation, and creating a fully functional program would require more extensive code and integration.

**Python Code for Chess Logic and Communication:**

```python
import chess
import chess.engine
import serial
import time

# Connect to the Arduino over serial
arduino = serial.Serial('COMX', 9600)  # Replace 'COMX' with your Arduino's port

# Path to the chess engine (replace with your engine's path)
engine_path = '/path/to/stockfish'

# Initialize the chess board
board = chess.Board()

# Function to calculate and send the best move
def calculate_and_send_best_move():
    with chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(engine_path) as engine:
        result = engine.play(board, chess.engine.Limit(time=2.0))
        best_move = result.move
        board.push(best_move)
        arduino.write(best_move.uci().encode())

# Function to receive and apply the opponent's move from Arduino
def receive_and_apply_opponent_move():
    move = arduino.readline().decode().strip()
    if chess.Move.from_uci(move) in board.legal_moves:
        board.push(chess.Move.from_uci(move))
    else:
        print("Received an invalid move:", move)

# Example: Start the game loop
while not board.is_game_over():
    calculate_and_send_best_move()
    receive_and_apply_opponent_move()

# Close the Arduino connection when done
arduino.close()
```
